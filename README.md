# It's just simple
You don't need to dedicate all your RAM to run MicroSuck whiteboard
Just run on local and do shit

## Brush Sizes, simple clearing, colors included
## You can Save ur stuff to png! 
TODO - the eraser is actually white brush, might look shit when saved :D

## Run easily by running run.bat on windows or RunOnLinuxMac.sh, opens in browser right away
*On Mac or Linux shell scripts need to be made executable with chmod +x script.sh before they can be run*
*runs npm i, build and preview*
TODO - exexuting build each time on run increases startup time
